# 🏡 Real Estate Recommendation System  

A Flask-powered web application that provides personalized real estate recommendations based on cosine similarity. This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine using machine learning techniques and seamlessly integrate it into a web application.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Personalized Recommendations**:  
  Suggests properties similar to a given property ID based on features like city, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and price.  
- **Cosine Similarity Algorithm**:  
  Uses vectorized property data to compute similarity scores for accurate recommendations.  
- **Interactive Web Interface**:  
  User-friendly interface built with Flask and Bootstrap for seamless navigation.  
- **Property Images**:  
  Dynamically displays images of recommended properties, enhancing user engagement.  
- **Responsive Design**:  
  Optimized for devices of all screen sizes using Bootstrap.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask Framework)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)  
- **Data Processing**: pandas, scikit-learn  
- **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity from scikit-learn  
- **Images**: Integrated using PIL and Flask's static file handling

## 📦 Setup Instructions  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-recommendation-system.git
   cd real-estate-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Dataset and Images**  
   - Ensure `socal2.csv` is in the project root directory.  
   - Place property images in the `static/socal_pics/` directory.  

4. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## 📝 Usage  

1. **Home Page**  
   - Enter a property ID in the form field to get recommendations.  
   - Explore suggested cities for additional insights.  

2. **Recommendations Page**  
   - View the top 3 recommended properties with details such as city, bed count, bath count, square footage, price, and similarity score.  
   - Property images are displayed dynamically.  

---

## 💡 Key Concepts  

1. **Cosine Similarity**  
   - Measures the similarity between property feature vectors.  
   - Ensures accurate recommendations by considering both numerical and categorical data.  

2. **Dynamic Image Integration**  
   - Fetches property images from the `static/socal_pics` directory based on property IDs.  

3. **Scalable Design**  
   - Designed to handle large datasets efficiently with pandas and scikit-learn.  

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements  

- Add advanced filtering (e.g., by price range, city, or property type).  
- Integrate cloud storage for image hosting and faster access.  
- Expand dataset with more detailed property information.
